/*Loan â€“ A public abstract class that implements the LoanConstants interface. A Loan includes a
loan number, customer last name, amount of loan, interest rate, and term. The constructor requires
data for each of the fields except interest rate. Do not allow loan amounts over $100,000. Force any
loan term that is not one of the three defined in the LoanConstants interface to a short term, one
year loan. Create a toString() method that displays all the loan data.*/
